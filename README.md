# hello-world
This is me following the Github "Hello World" tutorial, and using this repository to store files or ideas.

Whaddup, I am being prompted to describe myself briefly. I am an undegread student who is interested in web development and programming. 
I am working on my programming skills to develop fun projects, and contribute to the world of technology. I am also learning web development to learn about design principles, experience design, and have fun with the creative process. I hope that my programming adventures can translate into proffesional work as well!
